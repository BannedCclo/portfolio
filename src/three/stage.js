/* ===========================================================
   stage.js — one WebGL canvas for the whole page

   Every 3D moment on the page draws into this single fixed canvas. Sections
   register "acts"; the director decides which act is close enough to matter,
   updates only those, and skips rendering entirely when none of them is on
   screen. A full-viewport canvas with bloom running behind every section
   would otherwise burn battery for the ~80% of the page that has no 3D.

   The active act owns the camera. Acts live far apart in the document, so at
   most one is ever near the viewport, which keeps that ownership unambiguous.

   Scene/camera/renderer/composer are module-level singletons, created once
   on import — same as the static version, and deliberately not tied to any
   one component's mount/unmount. Only the two things that actually need the
   DOM (attaching the canvas, toggling its opacity) wait for initStage(),
   called from <Stage>'s effect once the mount div exists. That split keeps
   registerAct() safe to call regardless of which component's effect fires
   first, and keeps a StrictMode double-invoke of <Stage>'s effect cheap
   (guarded, not a real teardown+rebuild of the renderer).
