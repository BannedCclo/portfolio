/* ===========================================================
   acts/finale.js — the brain returns

   Closes the loop the hero opened. It reuses the geometry the hero already
   built and uploaded, so a second brain costs a draw call and nothing else —
   no extra download, no second pass of welding and smoothing.

   Where the hero drives the brain hard, this one barely moves: far off, dim,
   slowly turning, synapses at a low idle. The section's text sits above it.
