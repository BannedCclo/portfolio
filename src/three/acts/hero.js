   acts/hero.js — the brain sequence

   A real MRI-derived brain mesh (Nevit Dilmen, Wikimedia Commons,
   CC BY-SA 3.0 / GFDL — attribution lives in the page footer and is a
   condition of the licence, so it must not be dropped).

   Choreography, as fractions of the pinned section's 0..1 progress:
   the brain drifts in blurred and distant behind the title card, tilts and
   zooms into its settled top-down pose during "approach", then holds while
   three text pages take turns recomposing it into distinct side views, and
   finally the camera pushes in while the scene dissolves to the page
   background — so it disappears just before the camera would reach it.

   Under prefers-reduced-motion the pin never exists (see initHero()'s
   `else` branch) and update() takes an entirely separate path, updateStatic()
   — the brain holds the exact settled top-down pose the approach ends at
   (also, incidentally, the angle with the most margin against the mesh's one
   small hole — see tissueMat's FrontSide comment), title card and the first
   text page shown together instead of staged, pages two and three dropped
   entirely, and a fade continuously tied to how far #brain has scrolled past.
   The synapse shimmer keeps animating even though the brain itself never
   moves or responds to clicks — it's surface-local, not the kind of motion
   prefers-reduced-motion is about, and it's what stands in for the sequence
   the reduced path otherwise skips.

   DOM lookups and listeners live inside initHero() rather than at module
   scope: this module is imported (and evaluated) the moment React starts
   building the bundle, well before <Hero>'s JSX has actually rendered
   #brain and friends into the document. Three.js objects that don't need
   the DOM — geometry, materials, the GLB fetch — stay at module scope so a
   React StrictMode double-invoke of the effect doesn't re-fetch or rebuild
   them; initHero() itself returns a cleanup that reverses everything that
   *does* touch the DOM or the shared stage.
